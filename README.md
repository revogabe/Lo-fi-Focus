# LoFi Pomodoro 🎵

Pomodoro timer with a LoFi music player created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This application implements the pomodoro technique and tells the user exactly when to work and when to take a break.

The pomodoro process:

- Start a 30-minute timer or (customize time)
- Work until the timer rings
- Listen to relaxing music that helps you focus

The user is able to use the music player to play lofi songs during the pomodoro sessions and breaks.

This project was a great way to learn more about the HTML5 Audio API and to practice JavaScript topics like DOM manipulation, event listeners, and timer functions.
